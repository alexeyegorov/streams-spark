# Streams Spark #

This project is based upon [streams-flink](https://bitbucket.org/AEgorov/streams-flink) that tries to slightly modify [streams-storm](https://bitbucket.org/cbockermann/streams-storm) project in order to adapt it to ``Flink``.
Here we do the same procedure to adapt it to ``Spark``.
This way we can achieve parsing of XML configuration files for ``streams framework`` and translating them into ``Spark``'s data flow graph.
